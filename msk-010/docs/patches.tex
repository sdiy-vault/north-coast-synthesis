\chapter{Patch Suggestions}

Use the MSK~010 as a modulation source for a classical analog oscillator;
here, it controls exponential FM and pulse width.

For modules that don't have built-in attenuators, it can be useful to run
the outputs through an external attenuator like the Triatt.  The Clouds is a
good candidate for modulation with the MSK~010 because it has many different
control voltage inputs; you might even want more than one MSK~010 to take
full advantage of it.

\newpage

A small amount of sine modulation on a BBD's clock gives a sound much
like an unstable tape recording.

Mix slow sine waves and run them through a quantizer for an
automatically-generated but non-random melody.
