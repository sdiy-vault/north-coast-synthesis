Fixed resistors should be 1\%\ metal film throughout.  Capacitor values
are not critical \emph{except} the 470pF 1\%\ integration capacitors
(marked as such), which must be 1\%\ or better tolerance and should have
good loss and temperature characteristics.
RoHS-certified zinc-plated steel hardware is recommended, not stainless
steel because of galvanic-corrosion incompatibility with aluminum parts.

Also needed:  solder and related supplies, DIP sockets, one nylon cable tie,
PCBs, panel, knobs, Eurorack power cable, etc.
