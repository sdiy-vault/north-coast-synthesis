\chapter{Mechanical drawings}

On the following pages you will find:
\begin{itemize}
  \item the schematic diagram for the module;
  \item a mock-up of what the completed module looks like from the front
    panel;
  \item the top-side silk screen art showing component placement;
  \item the bottom-side silk screen art showing component placement
    (\emph{note this drawing is mirrored, and shows what you actually see
    looking at the board, not the X-ray view used in other Kicad output});
  \item a mechanical drawing of the front panel showing the locations and
    sizes of the holes in it; and
  \item an exploded isometric drawing showing how the boards and hardware
    fit together.
\end{itemize}
