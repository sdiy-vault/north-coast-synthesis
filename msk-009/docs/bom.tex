Fixed resistors should be 1\%\ metal film throughout.
RoHS-certified zinc-plated steel hardware is recommended, not stainless
steel because of galvanic-corrosion incompatibility with aluminum parts.

Newer kits may include TL074B op amps instead of TL074, to make offset
nulling easier.

Also needed:  solder and related supplies, PCB, panel, knobs, a cable tie,
Eurorack power cable, etc.
